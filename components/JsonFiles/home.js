             Abstract : In this talk, we will be discussing a critical security vulnerability that has been discovered in the Voice over LTE (VoLTE) interface of iOS devices, including iPhones and Apple Watches. This vulnerability has been present in the iOS operating system since the inception of 4G VoLTE, and we will shed light on the issue, its root cause, and how it arises due to improper implementation of GSMA guidelines, highlighting a design flaw in the implementation of the iOS IMS SIP agent.
             We will delve into the technical details of the vulnerability, providing a comprehensive analysis of its impact on iOS devices and the potential risks it poses to users' privacy and security. We will also explore the challenges faced during the discovery and disclosure of the vulnerability to Apple and discuss the response and mitigation measures taken by the company.
             Furthermore, we will discuss the lessons learned from this vulnerability, highlighting the importance of adhering to industry standards and best practices in the implementation of communication protocols. We will also provide recommendations for improving the security of VoLTE interfaces in iOS devices and similar systems.             
             This talk is a must-attend for security researchers, mobile device manufacturers, network operators, and anyone interested in understanding the intricacies of VoLTE security and the implications of design flaws in the implementation of communication protocols in iOS devices. Join us as we uncover the details of this critical security issue and discuss its implications for the iOS ecosystem.</> */}
